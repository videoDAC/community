# Private BOT Network on Public Blockchain Testnet

## Introduction

For new Orchestrators in Livepeer Network, it can be useful to do some thorough testing on a Rinkeby Testnet, before launching on Ethereum Mainnet.

These instructions are to help you set up an end-to-end Broadcaster-Orchestrator-Transcoder (BOT) network, using Livepeer. They are designed to help understand what is expected of an Orchestrator, as an actor in Livepeer Protocol.

For those familiar with command-line interfaces, these instructions ought to be completed within 30 minutes of work. For those less familiar with the command-line, you should allocate 1-2 hours.

## Requirements

You will need:

- 2 linux-amd64 servers:
  - Broadcaster (1Gb, 1 vCPU, 10Gb)
  - Orchestrator/Transcoder (1Gb, 1 vCPU, 100Gb)

- Some ETH on Rinkeby testnet (https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

- An ethUrl for Rinkeby testnet (e.g. from https://infura.io/)

## Set up O/T

Session 1: Connect to your O/T, perhaps via `ssh`, or other means.

### Download geth
```

```

This version was the latest version when this document was last edited. To check for newer versions, go to [geth Download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/), and raise an issue if there is a new version.

### Download livepeer

Session 2: Open another session on your O/T.

```
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/v0.5.17/livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz
./livepeer-linux-amd64/livepeer -version
```

### Run O/T process

```
./livepeer-linux-amd64/livepeer -network rinkeby -orchestrator -transcoder -ethUrl https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/677f7...5a8b3 -pricePerUnit 1000000
```

Follow the instruction, until you see `Received Ping request` in the console.

### Send some Rinkeby ETH

Send some Rinkeby ETH to the Ethereum address generated by the livepeer process in a previous step. 1 ETH ought to be enough.

Your Ethereum address starts with `0x`.

### Register the Orchestrator with Livepeer Protocol

Session 3: Open another session onto the O/T server:

#### Run livepeer_cli

```
./livepeer-linux-amd64/livepeer_cli
```

This will print some information about your node, and offer you a list of options:

```
What would you like to do? (default = stats)
1. Get node status
2. View protocol parameters
3. List registered orchestrators
4. Invoke "initialize round"
5. Invoke "bond"
6. Invoke "unbond"
7. Invoke "rebond"
8. Invoke "withdraw stake" (LPT)
9. Invoke "withdraw fees" (ETH)
10. Invoke "transfer" (LPT)
11. Invoke "reward"
12. Invoke multi-step "become an orchestrator"
13. Set orchestrator config
14. Set maximum Ethereum gas price
15. Get test LPT
16. Get test ETH
17. Sign a message
18. Vote in a poll
```

#### Get test LPT

Then choose option `15. Get test LPT`: type in `15` and hit return, like this:

```
...
14. Set maximum Ethereum gas price
15. Get test LPT
16. Get test ETH
17. Sign a message
18. Vote in a poll
> 15

```

You will know that this has completed when the cli shows you the menu again.

Then choose option `1. Get node status`: type in `1` and hit return... then look under `NODE STATS` to see:

```
...
*-------------*------------------*
| LPT Balance |           10 LPT |
*-------------*------------------*
| ETH Balance |  0.999913356 ETH |
*-------------*------------------*
...
```

You see, crypto UX _can_ be easy! ;)

#### Become an Orchestrator

Choose option `12. Invoke multi-step "become an orchestrator"`.

NOTE: At time of writing, the version of Livepeer Protocol deployed to Rinkeby is not up-to-date with the latest version on Mainnet, so the remainder of the process could not be completed.

## Set up B

### Download and verify version

```
wget https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases/download/v0.5.17/livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz
./livepeer-linux-amd64/livepeer -version
```

### Run B process

```
./livepeer-linux-amd64/livepeer -network rinkeby -broadcaster -ethUrl https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/677f7a6e77204b11bb8ced8e04d5a8b3 -maxPricePerUnit 999999 -orchAddr 89.145.162.114:8935
```

When asked to create a password, just press return, for ease of use, so that it enters an empty password, and means that you won't need to enter a password every time you run the process.
